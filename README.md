# OldMaiden
About the Game
This game is inspired by a childhood favorite we used to call Monkey-Monkey. In our version, the special card was the “monkey” (similar to the Joker or the Old Maid). Players would pair up cards during play, and the person left holding the last unpaired “monkey” card became the monkey for that round — often facing a playful consequence!
While researching card games in C++, I discovered that this classic is widely known as Old Maid. This project is my take on bringing that childhood fun to life in a digital form.

What I learned:
C++ OOP + unit testing
Event loops & frame update
Basic animation/tweening
Asset loading, input handling
CI/CD, cross-platform builds
Project management via Trello
Writing maintainable docs
